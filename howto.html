        <h3>Speakers</h3>
        <p>Request speakers and find a data that works for them</p>
        <p>You can also use <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTaa-_wOFOQv3dZ7Ord9TJ3vN8wNdzUY5VQqzFiTg_WMQwEw/viewform?c=0&w=1">this form</a> to ask people for suggestions.</p>
        <p>We also have a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LjLtzf4-QMh5CCtU6rjn95IvbV9AUAQHyQE7zlKndwE/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a> with previous speakers and future speakers</a>. Add the new speakers to the list.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 feature">
        <span class="ti-home"></span>
        <h3>Confirm the location</h3>
        <p>Talk to Impact Hub to reserve the location as early as possible! Basically once you've got enough speakers for a date, reserve the location!</p>
        <p>If the Impact Hub should be booked, try <a href="www.karldergrosse.ch/raummiete/raeume/">Karl der Grosse</a>, <a href="http://www.dynamo.ch/raumvermietung">Dynamo</a> or <a href="https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/sd/de/index/soziokultur/sozialzentren/quartierhaus_kreis5/raumvermietung.html">Quartierhaus Kreis 5</a>.
        <p>Find out what connectors the projector has, so you can give speakers a heads up info on that!</p>
        <p>We know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Karl der Grosse: HDMI</li>
          <li>Quartierhaus Kreis 5: VGA</li>

        <span class="ti-announcement"></span>
        <h3>Announce</h3>
        <p>Latest the day before the previous meetup you should put up the new meetup on meetup.com</p>
        <p>Ask speakers for a title and a short description, add that to Meetup.com and our website, but do not select to "announce" the Meetup yet.</p>
        <p>At the meetup you should announce the next meetup date and if possible the speakers and topics.</p>
        <p>The day after the meetup (unless it's a Friday, then wait until the following Monday), you announce the meetup on Slack and Meetup.com</p>

        <p>Ask the speakers to give you their slides, either as links or on a USB stick or something.</p>
        <p>It's a great idea to publish slides online, put them on the website.</p>
